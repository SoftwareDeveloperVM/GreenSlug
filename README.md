# GreenSlug

##Inspiration
Santa Cruz is known for it's strong biodiverse and agriculturally rich ecosystem, but lots of fresh produce goes to waste each years (40% in California). This leads to excessive food waste and pricing issues for farms and consumers (UCSC students and locals). GreenSlug was created because of this issue, since we can use technology bridge communities, uplifting Santa Cruz.

##What It Does
GreenSlug is the go-to platform for farmers seeking to sell their produce overflow. It allows farms to list their harvested crops that aren't suitable for grocery stores (often due to shape), and gives consumers a chance to support these farms. The consumers are businesses (restaurants, kitchens, etc.) and NPOs (non-profit organizations) who can bargain for the crops at a reduced price. The software facilitates these transactions by streamlining the process of listing and purchasing, with automated login and purchase authentication.

##Tech Stack
We built GreenSlug as a full-stack web application, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Auth0 for the passwordless authentication, Typescript for the backend logic, MongoDB Atlas on AWS Cloud for the database and the website is deployed locally.
